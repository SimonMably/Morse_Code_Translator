Enter some text - this can be a phrase, letters, numbers or any number of characters.

Press enter and the program will present the translated Morse code. To differentiate between each translated character, a space will be inserted in between each translated character and a forward slash (/) will be inserted in between each translated word. Characters that were not translated, due to no available translation, will be shown separately.
